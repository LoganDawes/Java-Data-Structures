How to Run The Program:
   
   My file name is Assignment04.java.

compile the file as: javac Assignment04.java

which will then produce .class files Assignment04.class, BinaryHeap.class, etc. for all .java files required.

run the program using: java Assignment04 <filename>
where,
 - Assignment04 is the .class file produced after the compilation

 - <filename> is the test text file that will be used as the input for the program, put this in the same directory as the Assignment04.class file

Example:
java Assignment04 inputFile.txt

will use inputFile.txt file as input for entering records.

Assumptions Made:
   - The program is being run with all of the .java files in the same directory
   - The program is being run with the argument inputFile in the same directory
   - The program assumes the input is provided via standard input.
   - It has been tested using Java version 17.
