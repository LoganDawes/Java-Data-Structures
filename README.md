# Java Data Structures

A collection of Java programs demonstrating the management of various data structures.

## Projects

### 1. Course Management  
Manages courses using a **doubly linked list**, with students managed as a **singly linked list** attached to each `CourseNode`.  
Features include:  
- Inserting and deleting both students and courses  
- Transferring students between courses  
- Displaying courses and students in a formatted output  

### 2. HTML Tag Verification  
Checks whether an HTML file (provided as a `.txt` file) follows correct tag rules using a **stack**.  
- If the file is correctly formatted, it outputs a confirmation.  
- If there are errors, it displays the problematic tag and line number.  

### 3. Waiting List  
Models a heart transplant waiting list using a **priority queue** implemented with a **binary heap** (array-based).  

### 4. Social Network  
Simulates a **university social platform** using a **graph adjacency list**.  

## Usage  
Each program contains a `readMe.txt` file within its respective directory, detailing how to run it.
